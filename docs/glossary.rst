    is used to create lightweight “virtual environments”, each with their
    own independent set of Python packages installed in their site
    directories. A virtual environment is created on top of an existing
    Python installation, known as the virtual environment’s “base” Python,
    and may optionally be isolated from the packages in the base environment,
    so only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are
    available.

    for a user with role ``Manager``.
