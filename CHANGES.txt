2.27 (2014-04-23)
-----------------
- fix mismatch between method name and security declaration
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1221624)
- ensure bind passwords used for the LDAP delegate and the user
  folder do not get out of sync


2.26 (2013-06-04)
-----------------
- Fix python-ldap error when receiving sets instead of lists for 
  attributes to search on (Patch by Godefroid Chapelle)

  Godefroid Chapelle)


2.24 (2012-10-18)
-----------------
- When comparing a login value to login values found on the LDAP 
  server strip the login value first. This follows OpenLDAP behavior
  which considers values as matches even with trailing or leading 
  spaces in the value query filter.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1060080)
- LDAPDelegate: When using a user from the Zope security machinery 
  for the purpose of finding a suitable bind DN and password for 
  connecting to a LDAP server, discard it when it's not been created
  as the result of a real login and thus has an invalid password
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1060112)
- use a known set of component versions (versions.txt from Zope 
  2.3.18) to avoid having to micromanage dependency versions
- moved change log entries for version 2.18 and older from CHANGES.txt
  to HISTORY.txt
- reformat HISTORY.txt and make it ReST-compliant
- clean up formatting of CHANGES.txt


2.23 (2012-04-23)
-----------------
- Add ``setuptools-git`` to ``setup_requires`` to prevent missing 
  files in the egg release - versions 2.22 and 2.21 will not build
  due to a missing ``VERSION.txt``.


2.22 (2012-04-23)
-----------------
- factored some tests into separate modules to increase 
  maintainability
- Moved all documentary text files into the egg root


2.21 (2012-04-21)
-----------------
- Make sure to raise OverflowError if no users can be found 
  when calling ``getUserNames``
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/972408)
- switch to using the standalone ``dataflake.fakeldap`` package 
  for unit tests


2.20 (2011-05-04)
-----------------
- Fix for CVE-2010-2944
  (http://secunia.com/advisories/cve_reference/CVE-2010-2944/),
  which was never reported upstream by the Debian people, who
  found the problem 8 months ago (see
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=593466).
  Thanks guys.


2.19 (2011-01-10)
-----------------
- Add attribute name to the negative_cache_key so requests 
  for same value but different attribute do not poison the 
  cache.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/695821)
- The changed base classes in Zope 2.13 did not define 
  isPrincipiaFolderish, so the user folder would no longer show
  up in the left hand navigation pane in the ZMI.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/693315)
- Fixed a faulty check for unicode so user expiration will not
  fail if a unicode value is passed in. Changed all checks for
  string and unicode to use basestring.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/700071)
- Fixed an export/import test error so all tests run again.
- The Manager DN Password value on the ``Configure`` tab in the 
  ZMI showed up in clear text when viewing the HTML source for 
  the rendered page.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/664976)
