Installing the LDAPUserFolder Product

  **NOTE**: Do not install the CMFLDAP extensions into a Plone site. 
  They are meant for pure CMF sites only and will break Plone. You have 
  been warned!

  The former CMFLDAP product has been folded into the LDAPUserFolder 
  package. The CMF-related pieces and their unit tests run on Zope 
  version > 2.8 and CMF 2.1.0 and up.

  You will also need a (working) python-ldap module installed for the 
  Python binary that is used to run your Zope install, see 
  "Important Hints" below.

  This product does not require any special handling after unzipping
  and untarring it in the Zope Products directory. You should do 
  something like::

    $ cp LDAPUserFolder-xyz.tgz <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
    $ cd <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
    $ tar zxvf LDAPUserFolder-xyz.tgz
    <watch files being decompressed>

  Windows users can use WinZip or similar, it can handle tarred 
  gzip files. Make sure to move the extracted LDAPUserFolder 
  folder to your Zope installation's lib/python/Products-folder.

  That's all. Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards.


  **Installing the CMF-related pieces into your CMF site**

  When you create a new CMF Site you can activate CMFLDAP
  by checking the CMFLDAP checkbox after selecting
  'Configured CMF Site' from the Add List dropdown in the ZMI.

  To activate CMFLDAP in an existing CMF site you need to
  visit the portal_setup tool at the root of your CMF site from
  the ZMI. On the 'Properties' tab, select 'CMFLDAP' in the
  'Active site configuration' dropdown list. Then visit the
  'Import' tab and click on 'Import all steps' at the bottom.


  **Upgraders beware**

  In order to avoid problems everyone who upgrades from a prior 
  version of the LDAPUserFolder should delete and recreate any
  LDAPUserFolder instance they have!

  
  **Important Hints**

  Depending on your choice of Zope install (e.g. compiled from source
  or binary version) you need to make sure that the python-ldap 
  module (see README.rst) can be found by Zope.

  The first step after compiling the python-ldap module is to find 
  out if it works correctly by firing up your Python interpreter 
  (the same one that runs your Zope, that is) and typing "import ldap". 
  Then hit return. If no error message shows up the module is compiled 
  and installed correctly. Many people get tripped up by the fact that
  Zope binary distributions come with their own Python binaries, you must
  install python-ldap using that specific Python binary that is used
  by Zope.
